DiceWords is a new way to more precisely work with dynamic prompting, and will be continuously updated and continuously unified with cleaned, well-done user-created material.
If you'd like to add your own stuff into the master collection, you can reach us on Discord:

Install instructions:

Update 10/28/23:
An install batch file has been added, in most cases it should take care of everything, and the app will be good to go.

Manual instructions for the unusual case the batch wouldn't work:

Make sure you have Python 3.10+
(3.10.7 or higher should ensure everything works, but 3.10 in general should work)


Open the main DiceWords folder (the highest level of the whole file)

Right click, then select "open in terminal" on that folder area.

Create a python virtual environment
Write:

Python -m venv .venv

Hit enter.
Then write:

.venv\Scripts\activate

This will open the new virtual environment.

Then write:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the dependancies. Then you can open main.py and run it in windows studio code.
