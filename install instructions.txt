Make sure you have Python 3.10+
(3.10.7 or higher should ensure everything works, but 3.10 in general should work)

Update 10/28/23:
An install batch file (start.bat) has been added, in most cases it should take care of everything, and the app will be good to go.

So long as you have python, 3.10+

...

If for whatever reason that doesn't work, you can do the follow, which is the manual method that the batch file would normally do for you (and while the below should technically be useless, we'll leave it up, just in case.)

Open the main DiceWords folder (the highest level of the whole file)

Right click, then select "open in terminal" on that folder area.

Create a python virtual environment
Write:

Python -m venv .venv

Hit enter.
Then write:

.venv\Scripts\activate

This will open the new virtual environment.

Then write:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the dependancies. Then you can open main.py and run it in windows studio code.
