Make sure you have Python 3.10+
(3.10.7 or higher should ensure everything works, but 3.10 in general should work)


Open the main DiceWords folder (the highest level of the whole file)

Right click, then select "open in terminal" on that folder area.

Create a python virtual environment
Write:

Python -m venv .venv

Hit enter.
Then write:

.venv\Scripts\activate

This will open the new virtual environment.

Then write:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the dependancies. Then you can open main.py and run it in windows studio code.
