A word surrounded by double code demarcation symbols (``) is called a placeholder, or in theme of the program, a "DiceWord"
The output, are potentials.

Example:

Input:
``pronoun`` was reading an ``noun``
Output:
I was reading an instruction manual

The DiceWord itself from which potentials come from is a .txt file, within a directory [assets->dicewords->YOUR_DIRECTORY_HERE] and each line of the .txt file is another one of these potential words.


DiceWord potentials each have a 3-4 part parametrical code following them.
This is the DiceWord's PIP, or Partitioned Indication of Parameters, 
[named that because pips are the little dots on dice]

The words will look something like this:

apple`g`nf`nt

This means, the word is apple, the maturity rating is 'G', 
it's non-fiction (nf), and it's nature themed (nt).

Take note of the symbol used to parse each part of the code.
After version 1.2, the order and number of parameters used doesn't matter.

You don't necessarily need the codes at the end of your words, but they help specify results.


Within the app, (maturity/realism) are set by sliders.
Genres, by a series of switches.

Code bank:

Maturity Levels (Note: Where your slider is on the scale will be read out in-app)
G = 0-50
PG = 10-85
M = 35-100
R = 65-100
X = 70-100 (With each additional X increasing the minimum by 10, up to three.)

Realism Levels
F = (Fiction) = 0-55
SF = (Soft Fiction) = 10-85
NF = (Non-Fiction) = 45-100

Notice that there is great overlap in levels, these parameters are generally loose except at the extremes.

Genre:
SC = Science Fiction
FA = Fantasy
HI = Historical
AD = Action/Adventure
MY = Mystery
RO = Love/Romance
CO = Comedy
MO = Modern/Basic
SR = Surreal
TK = Tech
NT = Nature
HO = Dark/Horrific

More than one genre can be turned on at a time to mix things up.

Secondary Genre
(List of possible genres, are the same as above.)

If you decide to list two genres, this is how the first and second genre's 
influence is calculated on results:


If there's a second genre listed *and* this secondary genre's switch is not on,
 the secondary genre can potentially be disqualifying, 
 with a 25% chance of doing so. 
 
 So the primary genre (first listed after the word) has the bulk of the influence.

If a word has a secondary genre and it's flip is switched, but the first (primary) genre
is turned off, it will be a coin-flip, 50/50 odds, if the word will be considered passable.


Potentially coming later: Selecting "Choose by paired genres" 
Will eliminate all single genre diceface 
from the polyhedral diceword's selection mechanisms. (Currently not implemented in version 1.4)

Information on settings will be displayed in the in-app cmd, so you can explore those at your
leisure.

If there's anything I've missed, experimenting in the app should clear *most* things up.
